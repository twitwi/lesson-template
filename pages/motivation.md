<section class="slide">
## Our Mission
We make scientists and engineering more productive by teaching them basic computing skills.

<section class="slide">
## The Problem

- Surveyed 1972 scientists in 2008.
- “How do you use computers?”
- “How did you learn what you know?”

</section>

<section class="slide">
## The Problem
- Scientists spend 40% of their time building or using software.
- 55% say this figure is rising.
- *96% are mostly self-taught*.

</section>

<section class="slide">
## The Problem
- No hard data on how *well* they do things.
- But anecdotal evidence suggests “not very”.

</section>

<section class="slide">
## Our Solution
- Intensive hands-on training.
- Two full days of instruction.

<section class="slide">
## Outcomes
- 20% improvement in productivity is common.
- 10X isn't rare.

</section>

<section class="slide">
## Outcomes
- Empowers people.
- HPC, the cloud, web services, big data, ...
- Reproducible research, open science, ...

</section>

<section class="slide">
## The Details
- Materials are all open access.
- Instructors are volunteers.
- Only cost is travel and accommodation
- (but contributions to central costs are welcome).
